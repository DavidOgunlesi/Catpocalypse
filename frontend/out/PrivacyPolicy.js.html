        &lt;p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.

        &lt;li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service&lt;/li>
        &lt;li>Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public&lt;/li>
        &lt;li>Protect against legal liability&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;h2>Security of Your Personal Data&lt;/h2>
        &lt;p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.&lt;/p>
        &lt;h1>Links to Other Websites&lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.&lt;/p>

        &lt;p>We will let You know via email and/or a prominent notice on Our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.&lt;/p>
